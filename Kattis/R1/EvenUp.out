\question[1] (Number Theory) Let integers $a,b,c$ satisfy:
\begin{align*}
a+b+c & \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \\
a^2+b^2+c^2 & \equiv 9 \pmod{16}
\end{align*}
Find all positive integers $k$ such that
\begin{align*}
a^3+b^3+c^3 \equiv 27 \pmod{k}
\end{align*}
is always true.
% k = 1,2,4

\question[1] (Number Theory) Robert was taking a test, and got an answer of $\frac{5+20\sqrt{17}}{3}$ for question \#999. The question then continued: \texttt{If the answer can be written as $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,d$ are integers, find $a+b+c+d$.} Most people would've answered 45; however, Robert realized there was a great chance to dispute. Find every possible value of $a+b+c+d$.

\question[1] (Number Theory) For some relatively prime semiprimes $l, u$, the number $lu^l$ has 2028 positive integer divisors, including 1 and the number $lu^l$. (In other words, $d(lu^l) = 2028$.) Find the sum of the distinct values $d(2lu)$ may obtain.

\question[2] (Calculus)
Jhin, Jen, and Jyn play the following game: Jhin chooses a number randomly from the interval $[0,2\pi]$ while Jen and Jyn randomly pick points on the circumference of a unit circle. Jhin makes a straight slice connecting the two points, breaking the unit circle into two pieces. Consider the area of the smaller of the two pieces. Jhin wins if his chosen number is larger than this area, and he loses otherwise. The probability Jhin wins can be written in the form $\cfrac{c_1}{c_2}+\cfrac{1}{c_3\cdot \pi^{c_4}}$ where $c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4$ are positive integers and $c_1,c_2$ are relatively prime. Find the sum $4c_4+3c_3+2c_2+c_1$.

\question[4] (word, yo) \textit{Define a word as any string of letters from the set a,b,c, ... ,x,y,z.}

This days, it so hard find \textit{good} word. All the word I hear are too big. I have pals. Help me find they good word stat.

\textit{A person's "good word stat" is the probability any given word that comes out of their mouth has a length of at most 4 letters, over the space of all the (not necessarily distinct) words they've said in infinite time. Write your answers rounded to the nearest integer percent}

\part[1] Hi, my name is Matt. When I speak, I have a $\cfrac{1}{3}$ probability of ending the current word I'm saying, and starting a new word with some random letter, and a $\cfrac{2}{3}$ probability of continuing the current word I'm saying by appending a new random letter.

\part[2] Hi, my name is Mike. When I speak, I have a $\cfrac{1}{2}$ probability of ending the current word I'm saying, and starting a new word with some random letter, and a $\cfrac{2}{2}$ probability of continuing the current word I'm saying by appending some new random letters. Given that I'm continuing the current word I'm saying, let $k$ be a positive integer, and let $L$ be the current length of the current word. Then the probability of appending $k$ new random letters is inversely proportional to $(kL)^2$.
% P(L,k) = (1/2) * (6/pi^2)^2 * 1/(kL)^2

\question[4] (more math) After realizing you've solved every math problem ever published, you begin generating your own problems. To do this, first you standardize notation. An \textit{expression} is defined as any string of symbols from the set \texttt{0123456789-+/*()}. Then, you define a \textit{modifier} as \texttt{[a -> b]}, where \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} are expressions. Applying a modifier to an expression replaces all instances of \texttt{a} with \texttt{b}. For example, evaluating \texttt{3-5} after applying \texttt{[- -> +]} gives an answer of 8.
